* todo
- tests (httptest)
  - not sure yet how i want to structure tests - seems hard to use the fixture pattern and i really like that one right now
  - e.g. for log other outputs are required - maybe i'll have to write tests by hand here
- middleware: [[https://blog.golang.org/http-tracing][tracing]], pprof
- systemd: socket activation
- systemd: paths for StateDirectory, LogsDirectory...
* limitations
- limited feature scope and configurability - the goal is something more barebones/simple
- no wildcard routing / certs
- no ecosystem of 3rd party middlewares
* misc
** git fs

type GitFS struct{ http.FileSystem }

func (fs *GitFS) Open(name string) (http.File, error) {
	switch path.Base(name) {
	// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12605576/git-special-files
	case ".git", ".gitignore", ".gitattributes", ".gitmodules":
		return nil, os.ErrNotExist
	default:
		return fs.FileSystem.Open(name)
	}
}
